<p>I bet you are curious about my first steps in marketing and communication!<br>On my side I was nervous, because it is not my usual job — but an indie dev has many roles — so let us see how I did.</p>



<h2>Strategy</h2>



<p><strong>First I started to look around for similar games. </strong></p>



<p>I tried to talk about Artillery Royale in their existing game communities. This did not work well. Those communities are already focused on another game and thus not interested in a newcomer. I even quickly look a bit spammy.</p>



<p><strong>Then I switched to a second classic approach: influencers. </strong></p>



<p>Problem is, I do not have an existing network (being my first time as an indie dev). So I started to build up connections with interesting people. This part was quite hard as much of my attempts stayed without response. But by taking the time to select the right people I had a few successes.</p>



<p>My final goal was to get the game streamed on Twitch, so potential players could see it running and get into it. I did not remember exactly how many streams I manage to get, probably 20 or so (and from my perspective it is a good score). But I found out that this did not convert.</p>



<p>Fact is, a twitch streamer, even having 5000 followers will only get a few viewers per stream, and even worse than that, those viewers are interested in the streamer person not in what he/she is streaming.</p>



<p>I also connected with people we call &#8220;content creators&#8221; — a concept that was new to me at the time — and they played, reviewed and made videos about Artillery Royale. But the people I could connect with do not have a big audience yet. So it fell flat.</p>



<p>This is no excuse but I would say I have two extra disadvantages: 1/ not being English native 2/ not being on the right timezone (while targeting the US), that makes the whole thing even harder.</p>



<h2>A big thank you</h2>



<p>I may have sounded a bit harsh by saying that none of my effort worked with content creators or streamer. But all the people that connected with me were really nice person. They may not have — yet — the audience to promote Artillery ROyale as I wanted, but it was a pleasure to meet them. Some of whom I really liked to talk with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="688" height="332" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitter-people.png" alt="" class="wp-image-382" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitter-people.png 688w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitter-people-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /><figcaption>Thanks to these incredible people, even if sometime they just say &#8220;no&#8221;. It always helps.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Current Numbers</h2>



<p>In an effort to be transparent, and show to other indie dev how it can be like, those are the number for the first 3 months (starting from zero):</p>



<ul><li>Twitter followers: 109 </li><li>Wishlists: 247</li><li>Sales: 8</li><li>Revenues (after steam commission — but before taxes): $73</li><li>Total players: 35</li></ul>



<p>Of course this does not look good, but it has to start from somewhere! <br>I&#8217;m not giving up.</p>



<h2>Next Step</h2>



<p>I have other strategies to test, the first one is to look for a publisher who could help in the distribution of the game. I am starting to work in that direction.</p>



<p>The second strategy would be advertising, but this need a dedicated budget, and I already exceeded what I could afford for that project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First, let me show you the official Artillery Royale logo!<br>If you ask me, it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Logo_Full_HD-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-266" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Logo_Full_HD-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Logo_Full_HD-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Logo_Full_HD-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Logo_Full_HD-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Logo_Full_HD.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /><figcaption>Made by Jean-Baptiste Dessaux, idea by Damien Balada</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Community</h2>



<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about Artillery Royale community. If you follow the game you now that we have a discord server where people can get news and give feedbacks about the ongoing alpha: <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://discord.com/invite/fq78teW" target="_blank">https://discord.com/invite/fq78teW</a></p>



<p>Growing a community is hard, starting like me from nothing and nowhere — I don&#8217;t have any pre-existing network — I&#8217;m often wondering how I can get people look at the game and more than that, join the discussion.</p>



<p>On the game side, the technical base is working, know I&#8217;m going to iterate and add content. More weapons, more features etc. but what I&#8217;d love is to have player engaged in the process, so I&#8217;d know that this game will be enjoyed as much as I enjoy making it.</p>



<p>You will probably see me all around the Internet posting on Twitter, YouTube and other game related platforms. I don&#8217;t know how to do that, but I&#8217;ll report on that blog in a few months, hopefully with some results! </p>



<h2>News</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="417" height="279" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Capture-décran-2020-12-03-à-10.16.11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Capture-décran-2020-12-03-à-10.16.11.png 417w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Capture-décran-2020-12-03-à-10.16.11-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></figure></div>



<p>Right now I have some pleasant news, first Artillery Royale is coming soon on Steam (as a “Coming Soon” page) and because — or thanks to — the hard work I had to put in that store listing (Steam is asking a bunch of assets and other questions) I have a bunch of nice screenshots, banner, icon and&#8230; an official trailer!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not one of my specialty + the game is alpha, so is the trailer, but still I&#8217;m proud of it</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGFDciDurID5U496UtkqRTQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> too, I&#8217;m not yet sure of which channel I&#8217;ll choose, but I let you know! Follow and subscribe to everything, and we will see which platform wins.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s Discord where all the news are aggregated, and where future player can take part in the development process!</p>

<p>Finding a name is a very hard task, and for a non-native speaker even harder.<br>I thought I had something with Chess Battle, it&#8217;s distinct, has some meaning and straight forward to spell. Not bad.</p>



<p>Unfortunately on some very early blind play tests people got confused about the name.<br>Some warned me that they were not good at the chess game and were hopping that the game did not need much chess skill.</p>



<p>RED ALERT!</p>



<p>Even if at the start, the chess theme sounded great for me, I did not think about that. </p>



<p>A game of chess is hard, and for most people, not even fun to play with. In that way Chess Battle sends a wrong signal about the game. And to be honest, it&#8217;s not that much chess related.</p>



<p>So here we are: Chess Battle is now called <strong>Artillery Royale</strong>!</p>

<p>When I spend too many hours on Artillery Royale trying to solve a problem or even iterating, sometimes I fall into periods of doubts.</p>



<p>I play my own game and I don&#8217;t see what I&#8217;m looking for. It&#8217;s not fun, not pretty, not well balanced. Full of bugs. In a word: it&#8217;s not good. From here it often escalates to the point where I realize the amount of work left. I feel overwhelmed. I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m heading to.</p>



<p>Mentally it&#8217;s hard to handle. The only solution I found for those moments is to step back a few hours, or even days. And hopefully, when I&#8217;m back to work it&#8217;s gone and I&#8217;m full of faith again (so far it worked like that).</p>



<p>I guess looking back at the accomplished work help too, hence my previous post about <a href="/2020/08/first-months-progress/">current progress</a>.</p>



<p>I thought it&#8217;s important to share those bad feelings too because as indie developers we face many challenges, but self-doubting seems to be one of the worst (at least for me).</p>



<p>Do not hesitate to take a break!</p>



<p>On that note, it&#8217;s holiday time for me, see you in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>From the idea, through prototypes, all the way to a playable demo!<br>Let&#8217;s see how far we are after 4 months.</p>



<p>A little bit of history: Artillery Royale started in January, I mean, it&#8217;s been in my head for a long time but I started to write down some stuff in January 2020 and I decided in May to give it a go by working on it full time.</p>



<p>Also, because I know projects work better with a scope, I arbitrarily decided to fix a deadline for the first playable demo to September 2020.</p>





<h2>May 2020</h2>



<p>In may I was playing with Unity own Physics engine and thought it would be easy. I also used an asset that allows getting destructible sprite very easily but, rests assured, all this will be soon discarded.</p>



<p>I also had a first prototype of map generator based on bitmap at the time. <a href="/2020/08/map-generator/">See details here</a>.</p>

<h2>June 2020</h2>



<p>If I remember well, in June I had my first game over the Internet with a friend. It was laggy as hell and I did not see how it could improve with my technical choices at the time. So I discarded all the networking part too.</p>



<p>I still was trying to get Unity Physics engine work the way I wanted, and it was quite convincing. I built a specifics scene to test all the parameters and stuff.</p>



<p>This is when I decided to implement the distance limit, here with a halo that prevents you to move more than a specific distance. After testing it for a while, I&#8217;m pretty sure it won&#8217;t end up in the game in that form.</p>



<p>I also iterated on the <a href="/2020/08/map-generator/">map generator</a>, positioning destructible objects and ammo/health bonus boxes.</p>

<h2>July 2020</h2>



<p>What an exciting month! In parallel to coding the game, I was also looking for a designer to help me work on the game. <a href="/2020/08/prototyping-ideas-with-a-designer/">I found someone</a> that has the exact style I wanted and he accepted to work for me.</p>



<p>We can see in those videos some of his concept art. Except that I started to tackle the hard problem: <a href="/2020/08/technologies/">implementing my own Physics engine</a>.</p>

<h2>August 2020</h2>



<p>With Jean-Baptiste, we settle down on Anima2D for the character animation and it&#8217;s pretty cool because I had some time to test some sort of ragdoll animations — something I always wanted to have — on this video, it looks stupid and full of bug but the final implementation will be great. I also worked on my own <a href="/2020/08/character-movement/">Character movement controller</a>.</p>



<p>In the last video, we can see that I started to integrate the final art from Jean-Baptiste. The <a href="/2020/08/map-generator/">map generator</a> has to be tweaked a bit more too.</p>

<p>To be honest with me I&#8217;m not even halfway to have something ready but I hope that in September I&#8217;ll get some sort of demo.</p>



<p>Fingers crossed</p>

<p><strong>Artillery Royale is a 2D turn based artillery video game for two players.</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Artillery games and today I want to make one!</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Note: Artillery Royale was named Chess Battle.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1474410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get the game on Steam  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></div>

<h3><strong>Let&#8217;s learn about the gameplay</strong></h3>



<p>There are two different modes</p>



<p><strong>Battle mode</strong></p>



<p>In this mode, the two players start on a randomly generated map, with a defined number of characters.</p>



<p>The player’s goal is to eliminate all of the opposing player’s characters. Either by killing them or by expelling them from the map.</p>



<p>There are 5 to 8 characters per player: the Queen, the Bishop(s), the Rook(s), the Knight(s), and the King (not present in Battle mode, see Capture the King mode below).</p>



<p>Each of these characters is controlled in turn by the player, he cannot choose which character he wants to control, the order is pre-defined.</p>



<p>The parallel with chess is done via character classes (Bishop, King, etc.) but also by the fact that each character&#8217;s movement is limited by its class. ie: the Bishop can only move within a certain radius, the Rook a smaller radius, and the Queen without limitation.</p>



<p><strong>Capture the King mode</strong></p>



<p>In this mode, the rules are similar. The characters and the map are generated and positioned symmetrically (face to face) and the King of each player is positioned at each end of the map.</p>



<p>The goal is then for a player to go &#8220;capture&#8221; the opposing king (touch him with one of their characters).</p>



<h3><strong>Let&#8217;s meet the Characters</strong></h3>



<p>Playing different characters in the same game is one of the keys differentiation from other artillery games. Each character is visually different and has different abilities (and special weapons see below).</p>



<p>The <em>Rook, for example,</em> moves slowly (because it will be quite big), the <em>Knight</em> on the contrary is more agile.</p>



<p>Here is the list of the different characters and their particular characteristics:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Rook: </strong>The rook is an imposing piece, moves slowly. Its special ability is to be able to make a protective force field.</li><li><strong>Queen</strong>: The queen is not limited in travel distance. It&#8217;s her special ability.</li><li><strong>Bishop</strong>: The bishop has a special weapon, his movement is limited, his speed normal.</li><li><strong>King</strong>: King&#8217;s movements are very limited.</li><li><strong>Knight</strong>: The knight&#8217;s special ability is speed and greater amplitude of jump.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Let&#8217;s discovers the Weapons</strong></h3>



<p>Each player starts with three unlimited basic weapons, bazooka; grenade; gun.<br>Then randomly on the ground, boxes containing a weapon appear. The player can pick up those boxes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Bazooka: </strong>Simple projectile, the trajectory is influenced by the wind, explodes when the projectile encounters an obstacle, projection force managed by the player.</li><li><strong>Grenade: </strong>Simple projectile, not influenced by the wind, bounced when encountering an obstacle, explodes after 3-5 seconds, projection force managed by the player.</li><li><strong>Pistol: </strong>Straight shot, not influenced by the wind, instantaneous (no movement of the projectile), no force of projection.</li><li><strong>Mortar: </strong>Simple projectile, the trajectory is NOT influenced by the wind, explodes when the projectile encounters an obstacle, no projection force.</li><li><strong>Bomb: </strong>Simple projectile, not influenced by the wind, heavy, rebounded very little when encountering an obstacle, explodes 2 seconds after touching the first obstacle, projection force managed by the player.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>



<p>Bonuses/penalties boxes appear randomly on the map. A player can pick them up and their ability applies to the current turn.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Double damage: </strong>Doubles the size of the explosions as well as the number of damage.</li><li><strong>Double distance: </strong>Allow the current character to move further.</li><li><strong>Everyone goes down: </strong>The ground sinks a unit in the lava.</li></ul>



<h3>Who is Jrmgx?</h3>



<p>My real name is Jerome, I&#8217;m from France.&nbsp;<br>In my everyday life, I&#8217;m a web/mobile/game developer.<br>I had some success recently with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glitch-clip-vj-for-everyone/id1487987092" target="_blank">Glitch Clip</a>.</p>



<p>Today I want to level up and work on a bigger project!<br>I&#8217;m really motivated, and ready to dedicate time and money to make it a success!</p>



<h3><strong>What are the Ambitions?</strong></h3>



<p>The goal is to make a PC / console game and then think about the mobile version. It&#8217;s a paying game, not a free to play. The game is intended for two players and is played either via the Internet or on the same machine.</p>
